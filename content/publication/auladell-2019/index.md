abstract: We studied the long-term temporal dynamics of the aerobic anoxygenic phototrophic
  (AAP) bacteria, a relevant functional group in the coastal marine microbial food
  web, using high-throughput sequencing of the pufM gene coupled with multivariate,
  time series and co-occurrence analyses at the Blanes Bay Microbial Observatory (NW
  Mediterranean). Additionally, using metagenomics, we tested whether the used primers
  captured accurately the seasonality of the most relevant AAP groups. Phylogroup
  K (Gammaproteobacteria) was the greatest contributor to community structure over
  all seasons, with phylogroups E and G (Alphaproteobacteria) being prevalent in spring.
  Diversity indices showed a clear seasonal trend, with maximum values in winter,
  which was inverse to that of AAP abundance. Multivariate analyses revealed sample
  clustering by season, with a relevant proportion of the variance explained by day
  length, temperature, salinity, phototrophic nanoflagellate abundance, chlorophyll
  a, and silicate concentration. Time series analysis showed robust rhythmic patterns
  of co-occurrence, but distinct seasonal behaviors within the same phylogroup, and
  even within different amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) conforming the same operational
  taxonomic unit (OTU). Altogether, our results picture the AAP assemblage as highly
  seasonal and recurrent but containing ecotypes showing distinctive temporal niche
  partitioning, rather than being a cohesive functional group.

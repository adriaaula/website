I am a student with interest in the ecology of marine microbes at the Institut de Ciències Marines (ICM-CSIC; Barcelona). My thesis is focused in understanding the ecology of microbial communities on a temporal basis through studying their seasonal patterns in the [Blanes Bay Microbial Observatory](http://webold.icm.csic.es/bio/projects/icmicrobis/bbmo/). I work both with amplicon and metagenomic datasets. 

I care deeply about open access science and the need of code literacy in the scientific world in general. A paper is the advertisement of the data and analyses behind, nothing else. 


When I am not science-doing, I am probably either worrying about climate change or climbing mountains.

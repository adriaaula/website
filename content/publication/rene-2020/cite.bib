 abstract = {Massive amplicon sequencing approaches to characterize the diversity of microbial eukaryotes in sediments are scarce and controls about the effects introduced by different methods to recover DNA are lacking. In this study, we compare the performance of the melting seawater-ice elution method on the characterization of benthic protist communities by 18S rRNA gene metabarcoding with results obtained by direct cell lysis and DNA purification from sediments. Even though the most abundant OTUs were recovered by both methods, eluted samples yielded higher richness than samples undergoing direct lysis. Both treatments allowed recovering the same taxonomic groups, although we observed significant differences in terms of relative abundance for some of them. Dinoflagellata and Ciliophora strongly dominated the community in eluted samples ($>$80% reads). In directlylysed samples, they only represented 37%, while groups like Fungi and Ochrophytes were highly represented ($>$20% reads, respectively). Our results show that the elution process yields a higher protist richness estimation, most likely as a result of the higher sample volume used to recover organisms as compared to commonly used volumes for direct benthic DNA purification. Motile groups, like dinoflagellates and ciliates, are logically more enriched during the elution process.},
